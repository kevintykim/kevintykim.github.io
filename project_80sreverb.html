                    <p class="portfolio-text portfolio-paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">From the start, this project was a process of discovery—of gaining new insights to broaden, or even correct, my existing knowledge.<br />
                        My first priority was to let users search for and play music, but I knew these two functions alone wouldn’t be enough—today’s users expect more from a modern app. Then came the phase of discovery: even though I had ideas for additional features, I analyzed existing music apps to assess whether or not my ideas were the best.</p>

                    </picture>
                    <p class="portfolio-text portfolio-paragraph" style="margin-top: 20px;">My research justified the features I had in mind—dashboards, navbars, and playlists. However, I also discovered the value in features I hadn’t previously considered, such as sharing songs on social media.</p>

            <div class="container">
                <h4 class="portfolio-text">User Flow & Low-Fidelity Wireframes</h4>
                <p class="portfolio-text portfolio-paragraph">Now with a better idea of how to flesh things out, I created my first draft of the app, compiling a tentative list of screens and arranging it into a user flow. This draft was rough, but it was a good base on which to continue the design process and expand my ideas later.</p>
                <picture>

                <p class="portfolio-text portfolio-paragraph">As I visualized the user flow on paper, my learnings from the earlier competitive analysis came in handy, providing inspiration for the screens’ layout templates.</p>

                    <p class="portfolio-text portfolio-paragraph">I used the low-fidelity sketches as a starting point, but I went in knowing changes would have to be made. This was another discovery-heavy phase, involving a good deal of experimentation with elements’ size, placement, and spacing. I also kept my mind open to ideating more screens (i.e., Welcome and Settings) and learning new ways to use the software, such as grid layouts.</p>
                    
                    <picture>

                    <p class="portfolio-text portfolio-paragraph" style="margin-top: 20px;">The app took shape through these wireframes, but afterward came the task of bringing them to life with a distinct visual identity.</p>

            <div class="container">
                <h4 class="portfolio-text">Icon Set</h4>
                <p class="portfolio-text portfolio-paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">I brainstormed at least three potential icons for each function, with a variety of shapes and line weights. The biggest challenge here was choosing which icons would go well together into a visually uniform set, but after some modifications, I decided on a group typified by its 2-pixel wide lines and/or gaps (circled below).
                    </p>
                
                <picture>

                </picture>
                <p class="portfolio-text portfolio-paragraph" style="margin-top: 20px;">I also considered how well the icons represented their functions, and if there was any risk for user confusion. For example, some of the Settings icons might be mistaken for suns instead of gears, and were therefore rejected.</p>

                    <h4 class="portfolio-text">Mood Board</h4>
                    <p class="portfolio-text portfolio-paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">The goal was to create a vibrant yet calming atmosphere evocative of the 1980s’ music and nightlife. The color palette's blue and purple hues reflect the decade’s futuristic leanings, and the stylish Streamster font was chosen to provide a similar ambience to the app’s branding.</p>
                    
                    <picture>
                        <source srcset="img/80sreverb/casestudy6@1x.png" media="(max-width:767px)" >

                    </picture>
                    <p class="portfolio-text portfolio-paragraph" style="margin-top: 20px;">These mood elements imbued the mid-fidelity wireframes with an aesthetic that would evoke both nostalgia for users old enough to remember the ‘80s, and an otherworldly allure for those less familiar with the era.</p>

                <p class="portfolio-text portfolio-paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">The final designs prominently feature dark backgrounds accented by neon colors, expressive of the 1980s’ techno scene.<br />
                    Changes were also made to the app's original concept. New features spawned new screens, including a search filter. The mood board's defined imagery expanded to include artists and album covers. The logo's vectors were modified to look more rounded and inviting. These changes were unexpected but welcome, elevating the mockups beyond what was first envisioned.</p>

            <div class="container">
                <h4 class="portfolio-text" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Retrospective</h4>
                <p class="portfolio-text portfolio-paragraph">‘80s Reverb was created both out of interest in creating a music player app, and out of my own love for 1980s music. My aim was not merely to imitate the apps from my competitive analysis, but to build a stylish UI that would visually capture the decade’s new wave spirit. I came away proud of my designs and features, but also eager to experiment with UI styles in the future. If I ever revisit the project or design a similar app, I would change such aspects as colors, icons, or grid layouts, to see if I can take different approaches to achieve the same overall tone.
                    <br /><br />
                    This was also my first time delving into Adobe XD, and I used the opportunity to grow my skills with the software. Some parts of the design process were more engrossing than others—for example, the icon set provided a surprisingly enjoyable creative outlet, while the mood board required greater thought and concentration. However, I overcame any challenges by stepping back to engage with the material more slowly and patiently. In the end, ‘80s Reverb was valuable both as a learning experience and as a design project.
