                    <p class="portfolio-text portfolio-paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">My first priority was to let users search for and play music. But since today’s users expect greater functionality from a modern app, I analyzed existing mobile music apps to identify common user needs and determine the most relevant secondary features. My research affirmed the value of dashboards, navbars, and playlists.</p>

                <p class="portfolio-text portfolio-paragraph">Now with a better idea of how to flesh things out, I created my first draft of the app, compiling a tentative list of screens and arranging it into a user flow. This draft was rough, but it was a good base on which to continue the design process and expand my ideas later.</p>

                <p class="portfolio-text portfolio-paragraph">As I visualized the user flow on paper, my learnings from the earlier competitive analysis came in handy, providing inspiration for the screens’ layout templates.</p>

                    <p class="portfolio-text portfolio-paragraph">I used the low-fidelity sketches as a starting point, but I went in knowing changes would have to be made. This phase involved a good deal of experimentation with elements’ size, placement, and spacing. I also kept my mind open to ideating more screens (i.e., Welcome and Settings) and learning new ways to use the software, such as grid layouts.</p>

                <h4 class="portfolio-text">Icon Set</h4>
                <p class="portfolio-text portfolio-paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">The app had taken shape, but next came the task of bringing it to life with a distinct visual identity.<br />
                    I brainstormed at least three potential icons for each function, with a variety of shapes and line weights. The biggest challenge here was choosing which icons would go well together into a consistently styled set. After some modifications, I decided on a group typified by 2-pixel wide lines and/or gaps (circled below).

                </picture>
                <p class="portfolio-text portfolio-paragraph" style="margin-top: 20px;">I also considered how well the icons represented their functions, and gauged the risk of user confusion. For example, I rejected some Settings icons because they might be mistaken for suns instead of gears.</p>

                    <h4 class="portfolio-text">Mood Board</h4>
                    <p class="portfolio-text portfolio-paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">My goal was to create a mood that evoked the 1980s, so the app could transport users to the ‘80s not just musically, but <i>visually</i>. This required extensive research into the decade—particularly its nightlife and techno scene—in order to curate the proper mood elements and capture the era’s retro aesthetic. Listening to ‘80s music during my research also helped me approach the task with the right mentality!</p>

                <p class="portfolio-text portfolio-paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Before working on the final mockups, I looked back on the earlier phases with fresh eyes, in order to see what needed to be changed or improved. This included updating the user flow with more features (e.g., a search filter), expanding on the mood board’s imagery to include artists and album covers, and modifying the logo’s vectors to make the font look more rounded and inviting.</p>

                </picture>
                <p class="portfolio-text portfolio-paragraph" style="margin-top: 20px;">The final design phase focused on refining and streamlining all of my rough draft work, and bringing everything together into a visually engaging music app that went above and beyond what I had first envisioned.</p>

            <div class="container">
                <h4 class="portfolio-text" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Retrospective</h4>
                <p class="portfolio-text portfolio-paragraph">‘80s Reverb was created both out of interest in creating a music player app, and out of my own love for 1980s music. My aim was not merely to imitate the apps from my competitive analysis, but to build a stylish UI that captured the decade’s new wave spirit. I came away proud of my designs and features, but also eager to experiment with UI styles in the future. If I ever revisit the project or design a similar app, I would change such aspects as colors, icons, or grid layouts, to see if I can take different approaches to achieve the same overall tone.
                    <br /><br />
                    This was also my first time delving into Adobe XD, and I used the opportunity to grow my skills with the software. Some parts of the design process were more engrossing than others—for example, the icon set provided a surprisingly enjoyable creative outlet, while the mood board required greater thought and concentration. However, I overcame any challenges by stepping back to engage with the material more slowly and patiently. In the end, ‘80s Reverb was valuable both as a learning experience and as a design project.
                    <br /><br />
                    Key insights that I took away:<br />
                    • When making low- OR mid-fidelity wireframes, don’t fall in love with your ideas. Always leave things open to change.<br />
                    • Color and imagery should not be taken lightly. Carefully consider how potential users will receive your chosen visuals.<br />
                    • For icons, design consistently. Pay close attention to details such as angles and line weights, and see if you can apply a similar style across all icons.<br />
                    • Simple sans serif fonts are better for body text, while more decorative and extravagant fonts should be saved for branding or large text.<br />
                    • For color palettes, take colorblind users into consideration. Vary the palette enough so that any user, colorblind or not, can distinguish the intended contrast.
